Mac OS X Monitoring Tools
=========================

A collection of scripts and tools to assist in monitoring Mac OS X and essential services with Nagios.

Overviews and use cases for a lot of these can be found in posts at my site:

Some of the features of these scripts include:

*   Checking the currency of backups with Time Machine, CrashPlan, and Carbon Copy Cloner
*   Checking memory utilization on Mac OS X
*   Checking SMC sensors (temperatures/fans) on Apple hardware
*   Checking the health of Open Directory masters and replicas on Mac OS X Server
*   Checking Open Directory binding & authentication
*   Checking the status of tasks scheduled or executed by launchd
*   Checking certificate expiry on Mac OS X Server
*   Checking DHCP & Software Update services on Mac OS X Server
*   Checking Kerio Connect statistics & performance data
*   Native (no perl, no python) file age check
*   Notify via popular notifications platforms Boxcar & Pushover
*   & more!

These scripts and tools were specifically designed to be dependency free, so in the case of all but one or two, they will run on a stock Mac OS X client/server system from 10.4+ onwards. Most of them are pure BASH, with a few Obj-C exceptions that will need to be compiled prior to use.
