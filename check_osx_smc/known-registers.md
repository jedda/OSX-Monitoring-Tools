Known SMC Registers
===================
This document details known SMC register keys for Apple hardware. These registers can be supplied to [check\_osx\_smc](https://github.com/jedda/OSX-Monitoring-Tools/tree/master/check_osx_smc) to monitor SMC sensor values such as  temperature and fan speeds using Nagios.

Working out new registers
-------------

These registers were figured out with a bit of web sleuthing, and the excellent [smc\_util](https://github.com/alexleigh/smc_util) by Alex Leigh, which can be used to list all registers and data types on a system. If you are trying to figure out registers for non listed hardware, i'd recommend starting there.

Submission
-------------

Should you figure registers that aren't listed here (non listed hardware/missing), and you want to share them, [contact me here](http://jedda.me/contact-jedda/), and i'll be happy to include them in this list.
